AI makes it easier for you to do things every day. 

Whether it is searching for photos of people you love, breaking down language barriers, or helping you get things done with your own personal digital assistant.

But it’s also providing us with new ways of looking at old problems and helping transform how we work and live. 

We think the biggest impact will come when everyone can access it.
